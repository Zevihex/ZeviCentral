      2 achievements left! I got the odyssey one done and golden bloon hunting.
      Only ones left include the daily one and the pesky reinforced bloon one which will still take quite a bit.
      I cannot wait to do a different achievement set, this has been a real test of discipline..

      Working on a C# project right now and finishing that up but soon I should work on the "Zeviverse". I'll be very excited to work on it,
      the hardest part is how to design, organize, and how to make it all look neat.

      5 left! One of the daily ones is very close to being done but there is still the other one that will take two months.
      Grinding is going alright for the other 3. Just gotta grind while watching youtube, they don't require too much attention and are pretty automonous.

      Should finish my c# tutorial project, then maybe I try to make a game in Unity? We'll see what I can do with C#.
