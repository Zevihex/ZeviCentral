      The last achievement I can actually do something about is only two runs away, about 3 hours. After that, it's finally time to start Super Mario Land!
      I have been waiting for this for a long time.

      Zeviverse progress is also going well, other than some bugs and other features to implement it is working pretty well.

    <p>
      Still the same 2 achievements left but the grinding one is at a soild 64%,
      one run is about 4% and takes about hour and 30 minutes so that's about 12 hours of playtime,
      which isn't too much if I do once a week or something. The daily one I still have around 50 days to go.

      Zeviverse progress is going quite well, I hope I get my first release out soon!

      2 achievements left! I got the odyssey one done and golden bloon hunting.
      Only ones left include the daily one and the pesky reinforced bloon one which will still take quite a bit.
      I cannot wait to do a different achievement set, this has been a real test of discipline..

      Same amount left, bouncing around with progress trying to keep the game as fresh as I can but it is hard with the super grindy achievements.
