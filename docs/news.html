      Same amount left, bouncing around with progress trying to keep the game as fresh as I can but it is hard with the super grindy achievements.

      Working on a C# project right now and finishing that up but soon I should work on the "Zeviverse". I'll be very excited to work on it,
      the hardest part is how to design, organize, and how to make it all look neat.

      5 left! One of the daily ones is very close to being done but there is still the other one that will take two months.
      Grinding is going alright for the other 3. Just gotta grind while watching youtube, they don't require too much attention and are pretty automonous.

      Should finish my c# tutorial project, then maybe I try to make a game in Unity? We'll see what I can do with C#.

      Busy as always with programming and work but spending a bit of time at night to get some achievement progress.

      So I'm stuck at 7 left... They are all easy in theory but will take a bit of
      grinding and still a couple months for opening a chest for every day of the year...
      Once that's the last achievement I will move on to my next project!

      Not a ton of stuff since I've been busy and I finally have time to just sit down and catch up with news even though there isn't anything much.
      So close for btd6 mastery, I can't wait to move onto something else though!
